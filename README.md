## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- A running LocalStack container exposing SQS and SNS (default port **4566**)

### Installation

```bash
cd localstack-web
pnpm install
```

### Running

```bash
# on host machine
AWS_REGION=ap-northeast-1 pnpm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3001` (or the port you configured) in your browser.

### Docker Compose Service

Add this snippet to your `docker-compose.yml` if you prefer to run in the same network as LocalStack:

```yaml
  localstack-web:
    build: ./localstack-web
    environment:
      - LOCALSTACK_HOST=localstack      # match your LocalStack service name
      - AWS_REGION=ap-northeast-1
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    depends_on:
      - localstack
```

## Development

- The backend lives in `server.js` (Express + AWS SDK v2). Static assets are served from `public/`.
- SQS and SNS dashboards are in `public/sqs.html` and `public/sns.html`.
- Home page is `public/index.html`.

## Release

**v1.3.0**
- SQS: Add send message (with FIFO support), peek messages, and purge queue actions
- UI: Action buttons and stats now aligned for a cleaner look

**v1.2.0**
- Adds SNS dashboard: list topics, view attributes, see SQS subscriptions
- Home page to select SQS or SNS
- SQS dashboard unchanged from v1, but now lives at `/sqs.html`
