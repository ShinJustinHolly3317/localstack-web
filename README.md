# LocalStack Web UI

A lightweight web interface to browse and edit Amazon SQS and SNS resources when using [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack).

## Features

- **Home page**: Choose between SQS and SNS dashboards
- **SQS Dashboard**
  - List all queues
  - View queue attributes in a friendly table (like AWS console)
  - Inline editing of writable attributes
  - Search bar, auto-refresh, and sidebar message counts
  - Loader overlay and success toast for smooth UX
- **SNS Dashboard**
  - List all topics
  - View topic attributes in a table
  - See all SQS queues subscribed to each topic
  - Search bar and resizable sidebar

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- A running LocalStack container exposing SQS and SNS (default port **4566**)

### Installation

```bash
cd localstack-web
pnpm install
```

### Running

```bash
# on host machine
AWS_REGION=ap-northeast-1 pnpm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3001` (or the port you configured) in your browser.

### Docker Compose Service

Add this snippet to your `docker-compose.yml` if you prefer to run in the same network as LocalStack:

```yaml
  localstack-web:
    build: ./localstack-web
    environment:
      - LOCALSTACK_HOST=localstack      # match your LocalStack service name
      - AWS_REGION=ap-northeast-1
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    depends_on:
      - localstack
```

## Development

- The backend lives in `server.js` (Express + AWS SDK v2). Static assets are served from `public/`.
- SQS and SNS dashboards are in `public/sqs.html` and `public/sns.html`.
- Home page is `public/index.html`.

## Release

**v1.2.0**
- Adds SNS dashboard: list topics, view attributes, see SQS subscriptions
- Home page to select SQS or SNS
- SQS dashboard unchanged from v1, but now lives at `/sqs.html`
